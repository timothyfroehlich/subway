# Subway: Under-the-Playfield Token Routing

In pinball, the **subway** is the hidden track running underneath the playfield that transports balls out of sight without clogging upper-playfield action.

**Subway** routes heavy, multi-thousand-token files out-of-band to a fast worker model (**Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite**). It returns concise structured answers or writes code directly to disk, preserving 90–99% of the primary agent's context window.

## When to Use Subway

Use Subway whenever:

1. **Reading a file > 350 lines:** Reading monolithic files directly into context pollutes your working memory. Use `subway read` instead.
2. **Comparing multiple large files:** Exploring architecture across several large files (e.g. comparing two complex modules or database schemas).
3. **Scaffolding repetitive code:** Writing boilerplate tests, configs, or type stubs that match an existing pattern file via `subway write`.
4. **Surgical edits:** If you need exact lines for editing, do NOT read the whole file. Use targeted reads (`offset`/`limit` in Claude Code, or `StartLine`/`EndLine` in Antigravity) — Subway hooks pass those through immediately.

## CLI Usage

### 1. Bulk Reading (`read`)

```bash
subway read --question "<what you want to know>" --paths <file1> [<file2> ...]
```

- **Returns:** Concise, high-fidelity bullet points. Each bullet leads with exact symbols, line numbers, or types.
- **Context impact:** Only the concise bullet response enters your conversation context.

### 2. Boilerplate Code Generation (`write`)

```bash
subway write --spec "<what to build>" --reference <pattern_file> [--target <out_file>]
```

- **Behavior:** Matches conventions, types, imports, and style of the reference file.
- **Context impact:** When `--target` is provided, code writes directly to disk with **0 context tokens** entering the conversation stream.

### 3. Direct Prompt (`ask`)

```bash
subway ask "<prompt>"
```

- Sends prompt directly to Gemini Flash and prints output.

## PreToolUse Hook Guard

Subway enforces context discipline automatically via PreToolUse hooks:

- **`view_file` / `Read`:** Blocks un-sliced reads of files > 350 lines.
- **`run_command` / `Bash`:** Blocks naked `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more` on files > 350 lines.
- **Pass-throughs:**
  - Piped commands (`cat file | grep`) and redirections (`cat file > out`) are allowed.
  - Targeted reads (`offset`/`limit` or small `StartLine`/`EndLine` slices) are allowed.
- **Fail-open:** If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unset or `subway` CLI is missing, the hook immediately allows normal reads so no agent is ever stuck.

## Configuration

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: API key for Google AI Studio (resolved from env, `~/.config/subway/api_key`, `~/.config/pinpoint/gemini_api_key`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, or `.env.local`).
- `SUBWAY_MIN_LINES`: Minimum line threshold to trigger Subway interception (default: `350`).
- `GEMINI_MODEL`: Model override (default: `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`).
